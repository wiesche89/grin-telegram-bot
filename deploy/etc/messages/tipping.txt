# Grin Tipping Guide

## Overview
This helper account lets you collect and send small GRIN amounts via the bot. Funds stay on-chain in the tipping wallet, and every command uses Slatepack for secure transfers.

## Basic flow
1. Use `/deposit <amount>` to request a Slatepack invoice for your deposit.
2. Pay the generated invoice with your wallet and wait for the confirmation message.
3. Transfer tips by running `/tip @username <amount>` once your balance is sufficient.
4. Withdraw any remaining GRIN with `/withdraw <amount>`.

## Useful commands
- `/balance` shows your current GRIN balance in the tipping wallet.
- `/ledger` lists the last outgoing and incoming tips.
- `/opentxs` reports any pending slatepack transactions still waiting for a response.
- `/adminamounts` is restricted to bot admins and summarizes deposit limits.

## Tips
- Always send Slatepack data as text or documents; the bot will detect the BEGINSLATEPACK/ENDSLATEPACK block automatically.
- Keep the bot token private and never paste the Slatepack into public chats.
