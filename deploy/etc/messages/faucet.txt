üí∏ *Receiving GRIN*
Nice that you want to use the faucet function üôè  
You can use the grin wallet to send a Slatepack transaction to the bot

There are two ways to receive GRIN from the bot

*1Ô∏è‚É£ User sends a receive Slatepack*
1 In your grin wallet click on *RECEIVE*
2 Enter the amount of GRIN you wish, for example 1‚Ä§0 „ÉÑ
3 Now you see the *Slatepack* starting with:
   `BEGINSLATEPACK. ... ENDSLATEPACK.`
   
   You can either:
   Click *COPY* and paste the Slatepack into the Telegram chat  
   Click *SHARE* and save it as a file named *‚Ä§I1‚Ä§slatepack*,
   then send that file to the bot

4 The bot will process the Slatepack and respond with a signed *response Slatepack*, either:
   As plain text in the chat, or  
   As a file for example *‚Ä§I2‚Ä§slatepack*

5 Paste the bot's response Slatepack into the box, or click *CHOOSE FILE* to load the *‚Ä§I2‚Ä§slatepack* file

6 The wallet will automatically finalize and broadcast the transaction

‚úÖ *complete*, thank you
